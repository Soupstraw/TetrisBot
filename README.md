# TetrisBot
The aim of this project is to create a functional top-layer application that would be able to play Tetris Battle on Facebook (https://apps.facebook.com/tetris_battle). This application scans the user's screen to find the game window, then analyzes the window to decode the current state of the game and then calculates the best move for that state. Finally, it simulates keypresses in order to move the blocks on the screen.
